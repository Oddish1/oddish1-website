			I am a freshly-graduated computer science student! I'm currently looking for jobs, but am definitely enjoying being out of school with free time to devote to projects like this one!

			<p className="text py-2">
			    These lists are by no means complete, and are really just compiled off the top of my head. Over time I will come back to refresh them, in the hopes of one day making complete lists. But for now this'll have to do.
			</p>
			<h4 className="subheading text-xl">ðŸ“– Books ðŸ“–</h4>
			<p className="text py-2">

			<p className="text py-2">
			  I watch too much tv... but I also really enjoy it. I realize some of the shows on this list are objectively not very good, but we as individuals have <em>only</em> subjective opinions... so... this is what I like.

			<h2 className="heading">What is This Place?</h2>
			<p className="text py-2">
			  This site acts as a place for me to put whatever I want on the internet! (áµ”á´¥áµ”) I have always admired websites of old with simple html/css and maybe a slight amount of php or javascript to add light functionality. That is the web that I grew up on. Then social media came around and everyone stopped making websites. Fastforward to about a year ago, and I started to realize that some people still did make their own websites. I learned about the indie web or small web or whatever people want to call it. So I decided to completely forgo social media (except youtube for now) in favor of just posting things on my own site.
			</p>
			<p className="text py-2">
			  I have already been more active here than I really ever have been on my own social media accounts. I never liked the lack of creative expression most social media affords it's users. This will be a place for me to nerd out on things that I like, share whatever I want, and hopefully inspire some other people to do the same.
			</p>
			<p className="text py-2">
			  HTML and CSS are easy to learn and I really think that everybody can and should build their own personal websites from scratch ... maybe some day I will write my own indie web manifesto. {'>_>'}
