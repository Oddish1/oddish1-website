## Environment Variables

Using environment variables is important to maintain security of your applications both in development and production. For this project I am using a `.env` file, in the repository there is an example file provided (`.env.example`) with the variables that are needed, you will just have to adjust the values. Below is what the example file looks like, just make sure to change the values and rename the file to `.env` before you run the dev server or build the docker image.

```
DATABASE_HOST=your-database-here
POSTGRES_USER=your-database-user-here
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password-here
POSTGRES_DB=your-database-name-here
```

## Development Setup

I am not using currently using docker for development. You will need an existing database, just make sure your environment variables are set up correctly using a `.env` file as explained above. You will also need a database and user that already matches the ones you have listed in your `.env` file.

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oddish1/oddish1-website.git
cd oddish1-website
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```
npm install
```
3. **Set environment variables:**
Follow the instructions above in [[README#Environment Variables]] to set your environment variables correctly.
4. **Run the dev server:**
```
npm run dev
```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore!

## Production Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oddish1/oddish1-website.git
cd oddish1-website
```
2. **Set environment variables:**
Follow the instructions above in [[README#Environment Variables]] to set your environment variables correctly.
2. **Build the docker image:**
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```
3. **Start the Docker containers:**
```bash
docker compose up
```
You can also use the `-d` flag to run it in detached mode.
